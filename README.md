# Personal-website-HELP-
I'm working on my website, and I copied the code of the nav bar from a different website, and I tried to combine it with another
chunk of code that makes it "fixed" but it is not working properly, somebody help!!!!
NOTE: all images on my website are from google, and this is a WIP.
